L-T,new intrimationthat me and dylan discoverd is that ant colines could have millions of ants there are diferent typs of ants theres 1 queen ant worker ants which are females and there are drones who are males when a termite whol is attact army ants spry a substance tat the attaker will not like ants like to eat friut and other small things i need to understand if ants are decomposers the reason i am wondering if ants are decomposers is because if a apple starts to rot and they eat it is that considerd decomposing
L-T,my theory is that rain comes into the mushroom which makes the steam or smoke what this theory cannot explain that mushrooms have no holes i need to understand how it comes to there spores is it moss new information about this from brainpop is that when spores or something does a thing called budding that makes it come off the mushroom not really this makes it in my thinking let the smoke come out when you flick it new information more info i have is that the mushroom is called the puffball mushroom new information as of 12 6 18 they dont spur out steam or smoke new information as of 12 10 the puffball isn't a mushroom it actually is a fungi but isn't a mushroom what new information more the smoke or steam is actualy dust like spores so that means that the smoke is actually spores that look like dust i guess i found the answer to my theory or did i new information i see that they get the spores out from getting impacted like the flick i saw at the albany pinebush i guess that's it here is a picture image kf6 rit albany edu attachments 5b87586745b8a02554df72de 5c0ea49ec0c1561fdba72c41 1 screenshot 20181210 at 12 37 47 pm png c 2018 wikipediaa puffball mushroom
L-T,new information decomposition works when organic substances break down nonliving more simple organic matter foxes deers etc this process helps ecosystems by turning organic matter into enerygy for other plants to grow in soil fungi bacteria and insects are the ones who do this process they're called decomposers
L-T,new information fungi like mushrooms midew andtoadtools are not plants they dont have chorophyllso they cant make their own food fungi release enzymes that decompose dead plants and animals
L-T,new information segmentation can help the earthwormmove each segment or section has muscles and bristles called setae the bristles or setae help anchor and control the wormwhenmoving through soil the bristles hold a section of the wormfirmly into the ground while the other part of the body protrudes forward here's a picture of what i'm trying to explain image kf6 rit albany edu attachments 5b87586745b8a02554df72de 5bcde679e196dc4872d2ce92 1 mating_worms gif
L-T,new information after what bill said plants are producers and animals that eat plants are herbivores when herbivores eat the plant that plant that has stored energy that goes into an animal willthen the animal have energy as well an animal that eats a herbivore is called a carnivore the energy will go into the carnivore when animals die there is something called decomposers which take the energy from the animal and put it in the soil for new plants to grow there this is called a food web quote from bill nye the science guy food is fuel and energy varsha's add on information
L-T,putting our knowledge together in each ant family ant hill there is one queen ant the queen ant gives birth to babies when the baby ants are born they are usally white as they grow up they turn black thousands and thousands ofants live in one ant hill like an apartment ants eat sweet fruits and other sweet things there are many different kinds of ants ants live everywhere

L-T,"ants can carry dirt on their back like when they carry food ant hills has lots of rooms like one of the room is where the queen lives and lays eggs if there is no queen ant but there is a ""king ant"" which is not a tig maybe the ""king ant"" leads their ant colonie to another ant colonie where that ant colonie has a queen"
L-T,bigger animals in the food chain kill smaller animals but smaller animals can kill bigger animals say if there in a pack then they could take down a bigger animal i think fish don’t need air to breath because they have some kind of organe in there body that lets them breath in water and have no need for airscientific methods are ways of making there questions better then they were before science should real step up its game by doing other things the courtyard interactions the courtyard interactions and i have been focusing on is the apple tree changing during each season is the tree dead will it have its leaves again the courtyard has a lot of dying stuff including trees animals and grass and plants scientists are working on a solution so plants don't die in the winter i hope it happens why and how do the animales get in the cortyard stop following me i want to be alone

L-T,some trees change color and die during the cold weather in the fall and in winter but some of them like the tall green tree and pine trees now you know why pine trees are christmas trees also it would be a little weird if you hang ornaments on deciduous trees deciduous trees are those trees that chane color in the winter and die
L-T,the following are examples of structures and organelles that can be found in typical plantcells cell plasma membrane this thin semipermeable membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell enclosing its contents cell wall this rigid outer covering of the cell protects the plant cell and gives it shape chloroplast chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthsisin a plant cell they contain chlorophyll a green pigment that absorbs energy from sunlight cytoplasm the gellike substance within the cell membrane is known as cytoplasm it contains water enzymes salts organelles and various organic molecules cytoskeleton this network of fibers throughout the cytoplasm helps the cell maintain its shape and gives support to the cell
L-T,"the information i have learned is all from brainpop new information there are over 12 000 species of ants many species have different behaviors i have also learned the ""exoskeleton"" around the ant protects the ant but it also helps the ant move about my final thing i learned was that male ants are called ""drones"" and their only job is to mate with the queen to create eggs afterwords they die"
L-T,why do trees need sunlight and water trees plants needs sunlight and water because**plants need waterandsunto make their own food energy photosynthesis the food that they make is sugar they make it on leaves plants also needs soil another fact * air can transport pollen and seeds fromplantsso that newplantscan grow image image shutterstock com imagevector diagramshowingprocessphotosynthesisillustration260nw563007307 jpgwe need water for roots some extra information are that leaves also give oxygen so if ther ewere no plants we would not have hair or anything so the only thing that helps us are motly improtantly plants

L-T,flora and i am doing a experiment with moss we put moss that was half way dead in a cup filled with dirt inside the cup there is a plant which was detached from the ground with it's roots and we water it every 3 of 4 days
L-T,grass hopers have 6 legs check your work please thanx
L-T,i already know that queen ants are made by eating a spcific type of foodweet food
L-T,i don't know but lets both do some esearch and we'll figure it out
L-T,i found a video of a tree that grows 40 diffrent stone fruits the the way the man who made the tree was he got a branch from each fruit tree and put them together with plastic wrap and it took 3 years for the tree to grow and it growd all by itself
L-T,i have to say that penguins can't fly ecause there only home is the artic and they have to stay there also because they where built for the artic to
L-T,i just found out that the plants take in co2 and let out oxegen which is what we breath in
L-T,i just found out they give off oxegen into the air which is what we breath in
L-T,i learned that there are different types of air poulltion can effect different people like in the video i saw ittold me that there are air types that are hazordus and can be very harmful
L-T,i learned that there are over 22 000 different types of moss but we mostly see here in ny fire moss and ceratodon purpureus moss
L-T,i now have found ut that they also use co2 to make there sugar to
L-T,i think that they have what they need they have food water and sun
L-T,i told you you have to do a 2 finger click when you do that you have to click the open link to new tab
L-T,iagree wit you spores are microscopic
L-T,in science we planted beans on 11 31 now it is 12 3 and there was no progress then i looked up how long will it take so my theory is that on 12 7 or 12 10 it will show some progress
L-T,inoticed that after the leaves change color the enregy is no longer getting produced so that could be a reason they fall off
L-T,it's a seedless plant it has spores
L-T,know i know why mosquito bites itch so much mosquitos are so annoying the itchyness can last for so long when the real bit part is only a few seconds mosquitos
L-T,looked like the start of a bee hive

L-T,moss forms by the little seeds that are let go by the moss
L-T,moss grows in cool and wet conditions and the moss groes back every spring after winter
L-T,moss spores spread onto certain things and they need sun and water to help them grow my theory my theory my theory my theory putting our knowledge together
L-T,o think that peguins need feathers to keep themselves warm
L-T,ok shreyas thanks for the advice
L-T,ok so ehhhhhhhh i love the advice thanks i'll reasearch more i promise
L-T,okay so ehhhhh
L-T,rhizoids attach the moss on whatever it's growing on
L-T,rivers are just lots of streams joined together
L-T,small animals and insects live in moss
L-T,snowflakes form depend on the tempreture of the air warmer simple formcolder complex form
L-T,so far what i know is that rain after it gets dehydrated it creates mud and later after thats done it creates soil
L-T,soil and paper towel have some progress it's 12 7 and we hve some progress the others have nothing so far i hope next week on 12 10 there will be more progress
L-T,some ants build there ant hills by weaving leaves togther

L-T,spores carried by wind they also need a little moisture
L-T,squirels are fat
L-T,sqwirls and chipmunks live in trees
L-T,thats not how you spell grasshoppers or info check this bill thanks
L-T,the animals and insects that live in the courtyard are mainly birds bees grasshoppers ants and antholes and possibly some arachnids
L-T,the answer is the sun pushes the air on our body and they call it wind

L-T,titariomyrma gigantuem size 6 cmmonomarium pharaonis size 2 mm🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜
L-T,today is the 10th of dec there is a little progress the beans are swealing like crazy i'm going to continue my work and keep checking and write more on those days
L-T,when i watched a brain pop video i learned that seedless plants have spores spores are kind of like the seeds for seedless plant exept they´re microscphic
L-T,yes exactly thank you its also made from sand and pine nedles
L-T,you also need co2 for photosynthesis
L-T,you should make a biger quashtion because you could just serch that up and mabey you can wach that brain pop video
L-T,you should make your question longer because bees live 122 to 152 days or early bumblebees can live 28 days
L-T,ω soil is a wonder and i've never heard of white soil and anyway soil is used for many things like plants chipmuncks and people
L-T,today we did a water challenge the challenge was that you had to move 100ml of water 100 centimeters to another beaker the challenge was a bit hard at first but when we got a hang of it
L-T,evaporation is water water is steaming
L-T,our plan worked here are our stuff we had 4 tubes 1 3 way valve 6 connectors 2 beakers always and a sringe and a measuring tape
L-T,putting our knowledge together when we worked in teams of 4 3 we made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange
L-T,during this experiment i learned it's kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because you have to come up with a plan etc
L-T,well i guess it could be hard if you did not have a plan but other wise it would not be that hard
L-T,it was fun to do with classmates and easy it didn't really make a big mess for us my questions are can we go longer and can it get harder cuz what we did was easy
L-T,starit was esey up thehoill
L-T,my theory is that we used the brown filter first than we used a carben then white filter and 150 0
L-T,our nitrate level was 50 our groups plan is in my section but failure is a road to sucsecion
L-T,yeah africa is closer to equator
L-T,comets transneptunian objects or waterrich meteoroids callled protoplanetsfrom the outer reaches of the asteroid belt colliding with earthmay have brought water to the world's oceans

L-T,i know that one diffrense is that sugar drinks have stuff likecornsyrupnatral flavorslots of sugarlots of lactose
L-T,1 sugar2 carbonation3 water
L-T,it could i also think that too
L-T,water scarcity happens when a place is too hot like africa the water evaporates more often
L-T,some ways humans purify water are *boiling*iodine*filtration systems*evapration traps
L-T,one way humans purify water is a filtration system another way humans could purify water is boiling the water
L-T,we need water because 75% of the human body is made out of water and also since plants need water and they give us oxygen and we need water to live and we get the oxygen from the plants and we give carbon dioxide back to the plants so basically almost everything need water
L-T,"putting our knowledge together to build on we all need water to servive you should wach the movie ""holes"" it will really help it gives you information about what will happen if you dont drink water and what will happen if you dont eat for a while"
L-T,wow you can´t we can clean it but making it is a no you can serch that ongoogle but still
L-T,"water scarcity has been happening in the book "" long walk to water"" because in 2008 nyla has to walk the whole morning to get water"
L-T,sorry if that was rude
L-T,freshwater is water that humans need to survive
L-T,salva has a journey to his home town to eathiopia at the beggening of the journey he had to walk and than get the honey and than walk some more and than get his uncle to join his journey and than let his uncle to hunt down food and than eat the food and than walk some more and than help fix the boat and than test the boat and than eat some food and than get mosquito bites and than travel on the river
L-T,hi guys sorry if the link doesen't work i am working on it so just be pastiont spelling might be bad
L-T,for this experiment at school that i did at class was that we tried to move water from the ground to the table and we kind of had some mistakes the litle plugs kept coming of and we did not get much water in the first test but on second we improved so it shows me that when you first do somting it does not go well but if your trying again you will succeed
L-T,i think in our group we should have put the tube inside the beaker and put tape around it more
L-T,fish have gills which help them breathe underwater
L-T,the water sikell is so in porentent for us as humens and us with plastic is so bad for evey thing straerrecycling or we are going toregretted most of our water comes from our oceans which are very dirty there is stillnot much left for the animals and it will be very disgusting cuz i was little pieces of plastic
L-T,our test diagram was the 3 way vowel on top and the pipe in the water the first test we got 41 ml and the difficulties we had were keeping the pipe in the water and the 3 way vowel we had trouble working it so we wasted some time what we modified we taped the pipe to the cup so it can stay and taped the cup to the table just in case the water we moved was 101 ml our difficulties were turning the thing on the 3 way vowel fast our controls pulling and turning the thing on the 3 way vowel and the thing that was hard and not fair was you can not touch the other things in enrichment some people went outside to get water they got a bit of water the people inside got more and we had to put it on our heads
L-T,my group put the coffee filters inside the cups and we put the carbin in it and poored the water in it was clean but it was blue next time i would only put a little bit of the carbin and a little bit of the water
L-T,the bule sand like stuff is the fertilizer
L-T,our groups plan was1 white filter2 white filter with activated carbon3 brown filter4 white fiterunfourtunaly our plan took out most of our nitrates wre taken out but our nitrate level was about 50 nitrates so in that case our water was still unsafe to drink
L-T,our groups desigened work we use white fiter then carbon and brown fiter next time we wont pour too much dirt water in the carbon so it wont go on the table
L-T,in class we had to filter water with a coffee filter and we learned that if you double the coffee filter over it will do better against the dirty water
L-T,to reflect on todays science expirement i know that i should use carbon as the second step instead of the first
L-T,so i think that our 3 part filter was good but we messed up on the actived carbon because we did not put in a filter so the water would just stay there
L-T,when we made the filter we used the w filter a carbon and then b filter when we filterd the water it turned out clear
L-T,when i did the thing which you have to try to turn the dirty water into clean it was kinda hard because my group sometimes fight but we did it but we thought we could use more of the active carbon but that made the water cloudy and dirty it clean before we use all the active carbon
L-T,yesterdayi puriefed water first you do the white filter and then you do the a carbon and after that you do the brown filter that's how you get a really good score
L-T,during the filtering expriement we did i learned that if we add to much a carbon it turns the water all black and cloudy in conclusion don't put a lot of a carbon in the water to filter it
L-T,when we first filtered our water it still had some bule in it from when it was dirty but when i was cleaning up i realised that it looked cealer it had no more color my theory is that filters work better over time
L-T,today we tested how much toxin was in dirty water and there was so much of it i will continue
L-T,"when we did our latest project it was about filtering water unfortunetly our water was gray i think it was becuase of too much air carbon we used it in two of our steps instead of one next time we need less carbon and also switch the steps around filtering water is important because nya's sister got sick from drinking dirty water my theory is that she got sick because there are actually nitrates in dirty water an nitrates aren't good for the human body new information that i want to learn is ""what chemicals are in nitrate and how are they bad for us to drink and how are they made exactly """
L-T,new information i learned was that with my group we saw way to filter wateruseing coffe filters it was so fun because when where doing the project and i saw that we were all having fun in the processe we also saw that we learned from our mistakes we had clear water but we though that it coud be more clean so we added more carbon and the clear water with the left over dirty water but it didn't turn out as planed so thats all i have to tell you about my team project i hope i tought you all something
L-T,in the last chapter ofa long walk to water salva visits schools to talk about the project and to raise money but then it skips two years ahead to 2009 nya looks at a man holding up a poster uncle read it out and now they have clean water as soon as i found out my prediction was that the man was salva and he was doing his project there and i was right but i also found out years ago salva's tribe was in war with nya's i know this becuase nya said that salva had different markings scars on his face also when nya got the clean water she was looking at the clarity of how it was so clear this made me compare it to when we were filtering the water and how it was a little bit more clear after i was also suprised when it was all based on a true story except for some parts this made me compare to when we had a budget of 100 and we needed to buy the materials without spending too much and we had to pump it and filter it and it was very hard but i think it was harder for salva becuase he needed the right materials and they were more expensive
L-T,i know that there is water in the ground it is called ground water if the people in africa drank groundwater would it be bad for them i made this theory by knowing that the ground has dirt would people in africa be drinking dirty water of would it be clean this theory cannot explain how the dirt is filtering the water because the soil has nitrates and the water nya was drinking could have been bad for her because of thr high nitrate levels
L-T,good for salva he did what he wanted he did what was wright for his people
L-T,my class and i finsh the booka long walk to water an it was really good we should really build pipes around places where people cant get water
L-T,the water cycle starts in a lake water evaporates and goes into clouds cloud gets dark nd fall of water and rains on land or lakes water travels through underground water ends up in the lake when land meets a lake
L-T,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part
L-T,lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth
L-T,transparent means full se through so nontransparent means opaque non see through
L-T,aura borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to france or italy the natives feared them because they thought they were evil things
L-T,photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light fact over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence
L-T,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head
L-T,those are the colors of your eye cones what i mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the secondary colors
L-T,the secondary colors of light are made by mixing the primary colors of light here are the secondary colors of light yellow magenta and cyan here is how their made
L-T,the northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter
L-T,a transparent object is something you can see though like stephanie light can go right though it
L-T,a translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light
L-T,when you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows and the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear
L-T,if you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue violet and indigo
L-T,my understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light
L-T,lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day
L-T,the law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray
L-T,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle
L-T,convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated
L-T,i also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent
L-T,another one of the things i learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time they could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow
L-T,when light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point
L-T,lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world it can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything
L-T,when white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow all the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-T,chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light i used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence
L-T,making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out an example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining
L-T,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle
L-T,a translucent object is not see through that means that you cant look through it but a little light can come through a translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer
L-T,a concave mirror has a sort of cave shape we have mirrors that are flat the mirror that i am talking about is that mirror but pushed in this mirror looks like a bowl when you look into it you see a long shape of yourself
L-T,a convex mirror is the very opposite this mirror is pushed out this mirror looks like a belly as we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down
L-T,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided the light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head
L-T,lasers are very bright and very strong they can go through anything if you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop
L-T,to make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light shine all of the colors in the same spot then you will see white light here is a picture to make it more simple
L-T,light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens whits is called diffused reflection
L-T,to make a rainbow withs prism is simple just get a prism and go outside then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow but sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-T,co lours of light you can make white light by mixing red green and blue primary colors of light light together
L-T,the secondary colors of paint are orange green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other
L-T,there are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes they are red green and blue they are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta
L-T,the gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point that point is the meeting place of the light
L-T,your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness in a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright but at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between
L-T,the angle incidents equals the angle of reflection
L-T,a defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror
L-T,you have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue they are all sensitive to there own colors
L-T,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally
L-T,you have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone the red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light
L-T,we have 3 different eye cones the 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue
L-T,a concave mirror looks like a bowl when light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below
L-T,there is some thing called the law of reflection the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror
L-T,a diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror its when all the light goes in lots of directions
L-T,objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous the sun is luminous as well
L-T,cones are things that respond to colored light there are three kinds of light that cones respond to red blue and green
L-T,light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light a prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-T,there are different names for the colors of light those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light there not just named orally the primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors
L-T,the primary colors are red blue and green the same colors as your eye cones
L-T,a convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave
L-T,a concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite
L-T,a convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you a concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close
L-T,you can add another lens to one of those lenses also a double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light
L-T,there are two kinds of light natural and artificial natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs
L-T,the second thing is fluorescence that is made with friction like when two stones rub together they make fire whits is heat and light that is fluorescence
L-T,news flash if you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed
L-T,and umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source that makes a big shadow that is pretty darker
L-T,a penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source that makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter
L-T,eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down the image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize
L-T,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it all the colors will come out the other side
L-T,an umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra
L-T,shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are
L-T,the rainbow is made up of colored light the colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
L-T,there are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue
L-T,a concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and
L-T,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large
L-T,when colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light
L-T,sundials are a form of telling time you can tell the time by the position of the shadow
L-T,shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in
L-T,a concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused
L-T,a convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking
L-T,all of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light
L-T,a transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through
L-T,a translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through
L-T,an opaque object lets 0 through
L-T,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection

L-T,blue and green make cyan and
L-T,green and red make yellow
L-T,all three primary colors make white
L-T,light and materials the most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors but first mirrors there are two kinds of mirrors there names are concave and convex
L-T,you cant forget flat mirrors there sort of in the middle flat mirrors are pretty important to
L-T,that law only works for smooth mirrors though
L-T,on bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions that is a called a diffused reflection
L-T,now lenses there are two kinds of lenses concave and convex just like the mirrors they do the same things
L-T,lenses are transparent
L-T,there are two other forms that translucent and opaque
L-T,a transparent object means see through
L-T,a translucent object colors the light and
L-T,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely
L-T,now artificial light first chemiluminescence chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light
L-T,then there are lasers lasers are extremely bright and very strong they can go through anything
L-T,there are two different ways you can play with shadows one is an umbra and the other is a penumbra
L-T,those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things those things are eclipses there are two eclipses that we know of solar and lunar
L-T,3 is it true that we cant see without light of course not

L-T,there are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial the kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers
L-T,photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves
L-T,the aurora borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive
L-T,fl you want to make white light you mix red blue and green together and you have white light
L-T,a lunar eclipse is when the earth is in front of the moon

L-T,biosciences are living things that have light on their bodies like the angler fish or firer fies
L-T,chemiluminescence are chemicals that create light
L-T,florescence is a chemical that glows
L-T,our class had a debate on how light travels at first we only had 2 theories straight wave then we had particles ripples wave inside a tub we
L-T,the secondary councilors of light are cyan yellow and magenta
L-T,wen you mix all the primary colors of light together you see white light
L-T,eye cones are in are eyes and some are sensitive to red blue and green and if the red con is not working then you cant see any thing to do with red or red
L-T,an transparent object is a objectt that you can sealy see through like glass
L-T,an translucent object is a object or material that you can see the couplers through it but you cant see crustal clear like rice paper
L-T,an opaque object is a object is an object that you cant see through like metal opaque objects are uselessly the strongest material
L-T,a convex lens is a lens that consent rats the light beam so when you look at the sore it will be a dot
L-T,thats the ope sit of a concave lens it makes the light sored out you so if your flash light wont sored out then you can holed up a concave lens to the sore of light and it will sored out and cover a larger area but with less power
L-T,the angle of incidents equals the angle of reflection that mens if you shine a light sore on a flare mirror then the angle you shewn the light on the mirror is the angle it will reflect
L-T,if you shin a light on a crumpled up puce of tin fowl then the light will be every where thats called defuse reflection
L-T,a concave mirror is a spoon like mirror if you walk away from it you mig is upside down but if you walk closer then its right side up
L-T,if you look into a convex then you look bait stretched outland the sides are rill bleary
L-T,a soler panel takes light and converts it to energy
L-T,photoluminescence is an living thing that pro douses its on light
L-T,chemiluminescence is a chemical that makes light like the halloween glow skits

L-T,a laser is a hilly intense tool its all the tools
L-T,an umbra is the dark shadow
L-T,a penumbra is the light shadow
L-T,water bends light
L-T,most lenses focuses light so if a weak but large source of light is being produced and you put a lens under it then it will make the weak light focus and become strong
L-T,some lenses make light spread out
L-T,there are many types of lenses there are glasses magnifying glasses and many many more
L-T,there are primary colors and secondary colors the primary colors of light are red blue and green
L-T,red and green make yellow light
L-T,green and blue light make cyan
L-T,and red and blue make magenta
L-T,and all three make white
L-T,and the secondary colors are magenta cyan and yellow
L-T,rainbows are light colors you can see
L-T,you make a rainbow with a prism if you put a source of light in front of a glass prism you usably don't see a perfect rainbow mane not even a rainbow but sometimes you can see a small rainbow
L-T,when light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror
L-T,if you use it with aluminum foil thats all crumpled up then light will go out at all sides this is called a diffuse reflection
L-T,there are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror
L-T,but there are two more basic ones one is the concave mirror this mirror looks like a cave it goes in and bounces light inside it
L-T,unlike convex mirrors convex mirrors can bounce off many sides those are the basic mirrors
L-T,if a shiny thing like tin foil is there but bent the law of reflection doesn't work the light goes all over the place
L-T,convex mirrors make your vision all you can see in the area bigger so if you look in a convex mirror you will see a lot more behind you thees are used in places like cars
L-T,your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but i have had light near and it was dark because i was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think i have benn there long enough but with no light i don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room
L-T,opaque transparent and translucent are some terms in light opaque means that its non see through
L-T,translucent means that some light can go through but not all so part see through
L-T,to see a white shrift glow you need purple light
L-T,chemiluminescence is the chemical that make things glow
L-T,fluorescence is the process of demitting light while receiving energy from another source
L-T,lasers are very highly bright and intense light they can burn though anything
L-T,here is a example of umbra and penumbra when you put an easer under a flash light the black shadow is the umbra and the gray shadow is the penumbra
L-T,the primary colors of light are green red and blue
L-T,yellow is made by mixing green and red
L-T,magenta is made by blue and red
L-T,and cyan is made by blue and green
L-T,this is how we see white we mix red blue and green all together make white
L-T,an opaque object is something that you cant see though at all like a base ball or a baseball bat
L-T,a concave mirror is a mirror that has cave the image looks like your head is bent
L-T,a convex mirror is something that looks like somebodies belly the image looks like your head is bent out ward
L-T,the law of relation is when the angle of incandescence the angle of reflection
L-T,when light hits a bumpy surface its rays are reflected every where
L-T,a double concave lens is a magnifying glass lens when light gos though it it soots out every where
L-T,on a camera there is a convex lens to help focus the light when the light gos though the lens it gets concertinaed
L-T,my understanding of shadows are that shadows are always on the other side of the light source
L-T,the closer you get to the light the bigger your shadow gets
L-T,and the complete black area is called umbra
L-T,and where its grey is called penumbra
L-T,my understanding of the primary colors of light are red green and blue
L-T,but the primary colors of pigment are yellow blue and red
L-T,blue and green makes cyan
L-T,red and blue makes magenta
L-T,and red and green makes yellow
L-T,of course if you were in pigment yellow would be green
L-T,every person has eye cones that are sensitive to a servant color each eye con is sensitive to either red blue or green
L-T,try clewing one eye then switching one eye looks more red the other more blue since we don't have a third eye we see blue and red and not green because in pigment its replaced with yellow
L-T,the northern light are the color red eerie green and pink
L-T,chemiluminescence is when chemicals make things glow like luminescent paint
L-T,fluorescence is when something is giving off light while getting energy from another source
L-T,my understanding of transparent objects is that if you look at it you should see through it roughly a transparent object is usually like a window some toys and glass
L-T,opaque is a thing that you can see and see through but its fuzzy an opaque object is like plastic
L-T,a concave mirror when light is shown into it reflects the light all around and then up
L-T,solar panels can make lots of things do stuff
L-T,translucent object let some light but not all light through so translucent would be like frosted glass or clouds
L-T,an umbra is a small light source that makes a dark shadow
L-T,also the farther you walk away the longer your shadow will get
L-T,when light hits a double concave lens unlike the double convex the light will go further apart
L-T,i learned that a magnifying glass can focus the light more than it can when the light is just by itself
L-T,another thing i learned was that 70 of the worlds sea fish use photoluminescence to make themselves glow
L-T,photoluminescence is when a animal gives of its own light
L-T,fluorescence is when something gives of light while receiving it from somewhere else
L-T,and blue green and red make the color white
L-T,red has the longest light wave and violet has the shortest light wave

L-T,a spectrum is another name for a rainbow
L-T,the northern lights are originally located in the north pole and some eskimo called inuits thought the northern lights were evil
L-T,a transparent object is something see through like a ghost or glass
L-T,translucent means that only a little light can get through for example frosty glass and tracing paper
L-T,opaque means that no light can get through for instance a cow is opaque and a chair is opaque
L-T,a concave mirror is pushed in
L-T,and a convex mirror is pushed out
L-T,some television screens in the 50s were convex screens
L-T,if light comes in on a 45 degree angle on a flat mirror it will come out on a 45 degree angle
L-T,on the other hand if light goes in on a 45 degree angle on a bumpy mirror it will come out all crazy
L-T,the colors of light is the rainbow
L-T,the primary colors are red green and blue
L-T,diffused reflection is when a light goad to wards a bumpy mirror and bounces in all directions
L-T,a transparent object is see through a prism is transparent and a peace of glass is transparent
L-T,an opaque object is not see through a brick book computer pencil and a tooth are all not see through
L-T,the convex lens is the very opposite this is to heal far sided people see near sided
L-T,the convex glass can also be used in magnifying glasses and in circus mirrors
L-T,solar panels are used for obsoleting light and made into electricity
L-T,photoluminescence is something that makes its own light
L-T,chemiluminescence is light caused by chemicals
L-T,a shadow wilel appear when you are facing north your shadow wilel be in front of you if you are facing south your shadow wilel be behind you and if you are facing east your shadow wile be on your right and if you are facing west your shadow is on your left
L-T,an umbra is a dark shadow
L-T,and a penumbra is a light shadow
L-T,when you see your shadow you'll see a dark shadow and light shadow is called a penumbra
L-T,my understanding of lasers is that it is a beam of light that can burn through anything
L-T,my understanding of photoluminescence is that some creatures like a firefly glows in the dark witch is called photoluminescence
L-T,my understanding of fluorescence is that it is a process of light while reviving energy
L-T,a concave lens is a lens that spreads out light
L-T,a convex lens is a lens that focus light
L-T,the law of reflection is that if the light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence the angle of reflection
L-T,a concave mirror is like a concave lens witch spreads out light
L-T,and for a convex mirror it focus light like a convex lens
L-T,a transparent object is a object that is see through
L-T,a translucent object is a object that is sort of see through
L-T,and a opaque object is a object that is not able to be see through
L-T,the secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta
L-T,eye cones are thing are that respond to colors that are red blue and green
L-T,the northern lights are branches of light color that usually found in the north pole
L-T,an umbra is the darker part of a shadow
L-T,and the penumbra is the lighter part of a shadow
L-T,a lunar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon
L-T,and a solar eclipse is just the reverse of a lunar eclipse
L-T,and red and blue makes magenta
L-T,and finally green and blue make cyan a shade of blue
L-T,the secondary colors of light are the colors that the primary colors make when mixing each other
L-T,transparent means see through transparent objects are ice and water examples
L-T,translucent means a little light can pass through like tracing paper and wax paper
L-T,opaque means no light can pass through all other objects are opaque and there are a lot of opaque objects in the world
L-T,diffuse reflection is when light bounces off of a bumpy mirror or a piece of crumpled aluminum foil and goes in all directions
L-T,the light rays from a concave lens go outwards like a v shape sort of
L-T,photoluminescence means that a living thing gives off its own light a firefly is an exemplar of a electroluminescent living thing
L-T,chemiluminescence means that an object gives off light because of some kind of chemical inside of it
L-T,things that glow are called fluorescent objects fluorescence
L-T,the three cones are green red and blue
L-T,red green and blue are the three primary colors of light
L-T,you get cyan when you mix green and blue
L-T,you get yellow when you mix red and green
L-T,you get magenta when you mix red with blue
L-T,those three colors are the three secondary colors of light
L-T,you get white when you mix all three primary colors of light
L-T,if colored light shines on a red pence case all the colors get absorbed but red red gets reflected
L-T,if colored light shines on a blue ruler all the colors get absorbed but blue blue gets reflected
L-T,if colored light shines on a black object all the colors of light get absorbed
L-T,if colored light shines on a white object all the colors of light get reflected
L-T,transparent objects are things that light can go through freely through glass and clear plastic
L-T,translucent objects are things that light can go through a bit like paper
L-T,opaque things are things that light cant go through things and produces a shadow opaque things are humans buildings and lots more
L-T,a convex mirror is shaped like richard massing belly
L-T,a concave mirror is shaped like a caves entrance
L-T,lasers are very highly bright and intense light it can burn through anything
L-T,photoluminescence are living things that gives off its own light
L-T,chemiluminescence is perused by chemical reactions
L-T,a unbar is a dark shadow
L-T,a penumbra is a light shadow
L-T,when a small light hits an nontransparent object it makes an umbra
L-T,when a larger light hits the same nontransparent object it makes an larger shadow then before and that is called an penumbra
L-T,when two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball one shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object
L-T,an opaque object is an nontransparent object but in an scientific way
L-T,i also understand that the shadow is always on the parasite side of the light source
L-T,the closer you are to the light source the bigger your shadow is
L-T,there are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only there is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was christian huygens the other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines and there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves
L-T,i all so know that when light goes in to a different medium it bends more like air and water those are different mediums
L-T,a laser is a really hot berm of light and it can burn mete
L-T,chemiluminescence is a chemical that makes light
L-T,photoluminescence is a animal that makes its on light
L-T,the secondary colors are cyan yellow and magenta
L-T,northern lights are colored lights in the ski
L-T,if you want to make a rainbow there are two ways to so you could either shine light on water or on a prism it will work either way
L-T,transparent is something that you can see through
L-T,translucent is something that you can sort of see through
L-T,opaque is something that you can not see through
L-T,a concave mirrors a cave shape mirror
L-T,a convex mirror is like a tummy
L-T,the law of reflection is the angle of incident equals the angle of reflection
L-T,diffuse reflection means when light hits busby service light moves all over the place
L-T,when light hits a convex lens it focuses the light and then speeds the light
L-T,a concave mirror takes in light and dress it out
L-T,the next view is the co lours of light view with rainbows a rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow you can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-T,the primary colors of light are bluebeard green
L-T,the primary colors can be made into the secondary colors
L-T,the secondary colors are reacknowledgment
L-T,and agreeableness
L-T,and bluejacket
L-T,and the secondary colors all mixed into one makes white light
L-T,all we see now to the all we see is light view a myriad of notes agree on that you can only see with light
L-T,photoluminescence is light created by animal
L-T,to make white light you need to mix all the primary colors together
L-T,to make a rainbow with a prism you need to shine light through a prism and it makes a rainbow
L-T,there is a thing called a color wheel
L-T,there are cones in your eye they are sensitive to colored light
L-T,if you stare at a picture of a green frog for 10 seconds then stare at a blank sheet of paper you will see a red frog
L-T,there are three different types of materials opaque translucent and transparent
L-T,opaque means nothing can pass through it
L-T,translucent means that it is see through but is colored
L-T,transparent means it is completely see through
L-T,a concave mirror focuses the light inward
L-T,a convex mirror focuses the light outward
L-T,de fussed reflection is like this
L-T,a convex lens focuses the light outward on the other side of the lens
L-T,a concave lens focuses the light inward on the other side of the lens
L-T,fluorescence is when a object is emitting a glow while getting light from another source
L-T,a laser is so very very strong it can cut through anything
L-T,a umbra is a dark shadow caused by a small light source
L-T,a penumbra is a light shadow caused by a big light source
L-T,our class has many theories about how light travels we have 5 theories 1 ripple 2 wave 3 wave in tube 4 particle 5 straight
L-T,there are 3 different theories about how light effects how we see the two theories are your eyes can adjust to light they cant and you see only the outlines
L-T,my understanding of light in natural and artificial light even though i am a master of that view i know that stars are made of gas not fire i found that interesting because before i read those notes i thought that stars were made of fire and only planets were surrounded by gas
L-T,i also learned lasers can cut through absolutely anything even diamonds
L-T,also i learned that 70 percent of the underwater animals use photoluminescence i also found this interesting fungi and bacteria use photoluminescence
L-T,a umbra is the darker part of the light that you may shine anywhere you see the umbra when the light hits something
L-T,the penumbra is a lot like the umbra but is the lighter part
L-T,in light and materials i know that a transparent object is see through
L-T,a translucent object is sort of see through
L-T,and opaque is non see through
L-T,you can see more in a convex mirror than a concave mirror
L-T,the law of reflection is when the indecent ray hits the flat mirror the reflection ray bounces back
L-T,a diffuse reflection is when light hits a something bumpy and the light goes everywhere
L-T,in co lours of light it talks about the primary colors of light are red blue and green
L-T,and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and cyan
L-T,if you mix the primary colors of light you get white light
L-T,if you shine light through a prism it makes a rainbow
L-T,the northern lights are usually found up north people used to be scared of them
L-T,there are two types of shadows the umbra and the penumbra
L-T,the umbra is a small and dark shadow you will get when you use a small light sours
L-T,the penumbra is a lighter shadow around the umbra you get the penumbra when you use a large light
L-T,you can use shadow to tell time with a sundial
L-T,and the primary colors of paint are red yellow and blue
L-T,the secondary colors of light are yellow cyan and magenta
L-T,the secondary colors of paint are purple orange and green
L-T,you can make white light by mixing red blue and green
L-T,light can be reflected and absorbed
L-T,the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis the aurora borealis is light there are lots of colors in the aurora borealis
L-T,there are 3 ways to describe an object the 3 ways are transparent translucent and opaque
L-T,a transparent object is like glass you can see through it
L-T,a translucent object is an object that is ike sand falling through water light can go through it
L-T,an opaque object is like peter light cant go through him
L-T,a convex mirror looks like the picture above on the right
L-T,a convex lens focuses the light
L-T,a concave lens speeds out the light
L-T,there are 4 come types of luminescences photoluminescence chemiluminescence electro luminescence and thermoluminescence
L-T,things that glow are called fluorescence
L-T,gazers are very strong and used for a lot of things
L-T,the sun is the most important light source
L-T,objects that don't give off light are non luminous
L-T,a flashlight is luminous when on but is non luminous when switched off
L-T,when an animal gives off its own light its called photoluminescence as in biomasses
L-T,chemiluminescence is produced by certain chemical reactions for example glow sticks
L-T,electro luminescence is produced by electric discharges for example when silk or fur is stroked or when adhesive surfaces are separated
L-T,thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks one of these sources is wintergreen life savers if you are chewing one turn the lights of look in a mirror while chewing look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks
L-T,a rainbow is made up of seven different colors red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-T,the primary colors of light are blue green and red
L-T,and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and sin
L-T,yellow is made when mixing green and red
L-T,magenta is made when mixing red and blue
L-T,and sin is made when mixing green and blue
L-T,they also have something called the law of reflection the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection to clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle
L-T,but first natural light there are two sections that i am going to write about first photoluminescence photoluminescence is made from a living thing like electric sale they make their own light therefore electric sale are electroluminescent so are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi
L-T,we did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows first we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows
