L-EF,I do not think so because Ive touch a tree that has fungus on it it did not come on to me 
L-EF,fungus etch dead thing not grow on them
L-EF,fungi and fungus is piratically the same thing   because fungi etch what eve its on sow does fungus but mi us geeing
L-EF,I think so to I ha seen mold on blue sees 
L-EF,is that fungus mushrooms give trees minerals and the tree gives the fungi mushrooms sugar 
L-F, I think that it takes a week or more for fungi to spread I think that fungi spreads to eat and to get energy
L-F, I think that fungus is basically mold because they look the same  there both the same ripe
L-F,I think fungus is a related to mold  like there in the same family there in a family
L-F, I disagree fungi is related to mold they look the same and there in the same family
L-F,how does fungi help the planet I think it helps the trees grow
L-EF,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part 
L-EF,Your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but I have had light near and it was dark because I was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think I have Benn there long enough but with no light I don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room 
L-EF,Lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut Simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth  
L-EF,Transparent means full SE through so nontransparent means opaque non SEe through 
L-EF,Aura Borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to France or Italy The natives feared them because they thought they were evil things 
L-EF,Photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light FACT over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence 
L-EF,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head 
L-EF,those are the colors of your eye cones What I mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the Secondary colors 
L-EF,The Secondary colors of light are made by mixing the Primary colors of light here are the Secondary colors of light  Yellow Magenta and Cyan here is how their made  
L-EF,the Northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter 
L-EF,A transparent object is something you can see though like Stephanie light can go right though it 
L-EF,A translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light  
L-EF,When you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows And the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear 
L-EF,If you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet and Indigo
L-EF,My understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light 
L-EF,Lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth Laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day 
L-EF,The law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray 
L-EF,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle 
L-EF,Convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated 
L-EF,I also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent 
L-EF,Another one of the things I learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time They could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow 
L-EF,When light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point 
L-EF,Lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world It can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything 
L-EF,When white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow All the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-EF,Chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light I used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence 
L-EF,Making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out An example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining 
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection When an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle 
L-EF,A translucent object is not see through That means that you cant look through it But a little light can come through A translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer 
L-EF,A concave mirror has a sort of cave shape We have mirrors that are flat the mirror that I am talking about is that mirror but pushed in This mirror looks like a bowl When you look into it you see a long shape of yourself 
L-EF,a convex mirror is the very opposite This mirror is pushed out This mirror looks like a belly As we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down 
L-EF,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided The light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head 
L-EF,lasers are very bright and very strong They can go through anything If you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop 
L-EF,a shadow wilel appear when you are facing north Your shadow wilel be in front of you If you are facing south your shadow wilel be behind you And if you are facing east your shadow wile be on your right and if you are facing west your shadow is on your left 
L-EF,To make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light Shine all of the colors in the same spot Then you will see white light Here is a picture to make it more simple 
L-EF,Light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens  whits is called diffused reflection 
L-EF,To make a rainbow withs prism is simple  Just get a prism and go outside Then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow But sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-EF,Co lours of light You can make white light by mixing red green and blue  primary colors of light light together 
L-EF,The secondary colors of paint are orange  green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other 
L-EF,There are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes They are red green and blue They are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta 
L-EF,The gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point That point is the meeting place of the light 
L-EF,Your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness In a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright But at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between 
L-EF,The angle incidents equals the angle of reflection 
L-EF,A defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror 
L-EF,When two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball One shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object 
L-EF,There are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only There is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was Christian Huygens The other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines And there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves 
L-EF,You have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue They are all sensitive to there own colors 
L-EF,The next view is the Co lours of Light view with rainbows A rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow You can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-EF,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally 
L-EF,You have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone The red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light 
L-EF,We have 3 different eye cones The 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue 
L-EF,A concave mirror looks like a bowl When light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below 
L-EF,There is some thing called the law of reflection The law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror 
L-EF,A diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror Its when all the light goes in lots of directions 
L-EF,Objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects Light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous The sun is luminous as well 
L-EF,Thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks One of these sources is wintergreen Life Savers If you are chewing one turn the lights of  Look in a mirror while chewing Look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks 
L-EF,Cones are things that respond to colored light There are three kinds of light that cones respond to Red blue and green 
L-EF,Light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light A prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet 
L-EF,There are different names for the colors of light Those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light There not just named orally The primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors 
L-EF,The primary colors are red blue and green The same colors as your eye cones 
L-EF,A convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave 
L-EF,A concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite 
L-EF,A convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you A concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up Concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close 
L-EF,They also have something called the law of reflection The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection To clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle 
L-EF,You can add another lens to one of those lenses also A double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light 
L-EF,There are two kinds of light Natural and artificial Natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs 
L-EF,But first natural light There are two sections that I am going to write about First photoluminescence Photoluminescence is made from a living thing Like electric sale They make their own light Therefore electric sale are electroluminescent So are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi 
L-EF,The second thing is fluorescence That is made with friction Like when two stones rub together They make fire whits is heat and light That is fluorescence 
L-EF,News flash If you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed 
L-EF,And umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source That makes a big shadow that is pretty darker 
L-EF,A penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source That makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter 
L-EF,Eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down The image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize 
L-EF,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it All the colors will come out the other side
L-EF,An umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra 
L-EF,We did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows First we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows 
L-EF,Shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are 
L-EF,The rainbow is made up of colored light The colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet 
L-EF,There are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue 
L-EF,A concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and 
L-EF,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large 
L-EF,When colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light 
L-EF,Sundials are a form of telling time You can tell the time by the position of the shadow 
L-EF,Shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in 
L-EF,A concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused 
L-EF,A convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking 
L-F,All of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light 
L-F,A transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through 
L-F,A translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through 
L-F,An opaque object lets 0 through 
L-F,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection 
L-F,The secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple 
L-F,Red and blue make magenta 
L-F,Blue and green make cyan and 
L-F,green and red make yellow 
L-F,All three primary colors make white 
L-F,Light and materials The most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors But first mirrors There are two kinds of mirrors There names are concave and convex 
L-F,You cant forget flat mirrors There sort of in the middle Flat mirrors are pretty important to 
L-F,That law only works for smooth mirrors though 
L-F,On bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions That is a called a diffused reflection 
L-F,Now lenses There are two kinds of lenses Concave and convex Just like the mirrors they do the same things 
L-F,Lenses are transparent 
L-F,There are two other forms that Translucent and opaque 
L-F,A transparent object means see through 
L-F,a translucent object colors the light and 
L-F,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely 
L-F,Now  artificial light First chemiluminescence Chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light 
L-F,Then there are lasers Lasers are extremely bright and very strong They can go through anything 
L-F,There are two different ways you can play with shadows One is an umbra and the other is a penumbra 
L-F,Those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things Those things are eclipses There are two eclipses that we know of Solar and lunar 
L-F,3 Is it true that we cant see without light Of course not 
L-F,The colors of light I think are in the rainbow winch are redOrangeYellowGreenBlueIndigoand Violet 
L-F,The primary colors of light are red green and blue 
L-F,the primary colors of pigment paint are Bluebeard yellow 
L-F,There are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial The kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers 
L-F,Photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves 
L-F,The aurora Borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive 
L-F,fl you want to make white light you mix red blue and green together and you have white light 
L-F,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is in front of the moon 
L-F,a solar eclipse is when the moon goes in front of the earth 
L-F,A concave mirror is a mirror that is bent in 
L-F,A convex mirror is a mirror that is bent out 
L-F,Photoluminescence is made by animals whose habits don't have much light 
L-F,Misalliance is made by semicircles 
L-F,Transparent objects are objects that you see threw 
L-F,translucent is when only some light can shine threw 
L-F,concave mirrors reflect light out and convex mirrors footrace the light 
L-F,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the light goes onto the mirror and bounces in the isopleth direction 
L-F,the law of diffuse refection is the light goes to the mirror and bounces in the same detection 
L-F,concave lenses and light rays help near sited people see far sited and 
L-F,convex mirrors help far sited people see near sited 
L-F,solar powered things are made with solar panels 
L-F,lasers are a toolbox they melt mettle 
L-F,An penumbra is a shadow shining around the shadow 
L-F,An umbra is a dark shadow that comes from a small light 
L-F,An opaque is an nontransparent thing 
L-F,Chemiluminescence is produced by a chemical reaction 
L-F,Luminescence is made by living things 
L-F,Lasers are very bright and intense and can burn through anything 
L-F,Things that glow have florescences 
L-F,Co lours of light The primary colors of light are red blue and green 
L-F,And the secondary colors of light are yellow magenta and cyan 
L-F,Black light is made up of all the colors 
L-F,and white light reflects everything 
L-F,If you look at something that is blue all the colors are absorbed except blue and that is for every other color 
L-F,Light and materials A transparent object is a see through 
L-F,a translucent object is see through but a little burier 
L-F,An opaque object is not see through 
L-F,The law of reflection is if light hit s a mirror on a 90 degree angle and it goes back ons 90 degree angle 
L-F,Diffuse reflection is if you crumple tin foil the light goes all over the place 
L-F,A convex lens concentrates the light 
L-F,a concave lens spreads the light out 
L-F,the primary colors of light are red green and blue 
L-F,The secondary colors of light are Yellow magenta and cyan 
L-F,White light is made from the primary colors mixed 
L-F,If you shine light on a prism it makes a rainbow
L-F,Eye cones are cones in your eyes that help you see colors 
L-F,Northern lights are colored lights 
L-F,Transparent objects are objects that can not be seen through and are opaque 
L-F,Translucent objects are objects are you can see through but not perfectly 
L-F,An opaque object is a object that is sold and cannot be seen through 
L-F,The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection 
L-F,If you shine a light source on a crinkly piece of tinfoil the reflection goes every where and is called a diffuse reflection 
L-F,A concave lens goes in 
L-F,and a convex lens goes out 
L-F,Solar panels are panels used with light 
L-F,Photoluminescence is a animal that makes its own light 
L-F,Chemiluminescence is chemical made light 
L-F,fluorescence is things that glow like a glow sticks from a party 
L-F,Lasers are a really strong form of light
